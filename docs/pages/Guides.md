# Concepts

Webda relies on Services (or Beans), they can expose some Routes and the Application can deployed using different types of Deployment

## Services

### Parameters

The service will be injected with parameters based on this expression

```js
{...app.parameters, ...deployment.parameters, ...service.parameters, ...deployment.service.parameters}
```

It allows you to share parameters with all services by defining them in the `parameters` section of `webda.config.json`
A deployment can then decide to override this parameters allowing you to override for example the `website` parameter to your specific deployment value.

## Routes

After all webda is there to create API, a Service can manage a route by using the `@Route` annotation or use the `._addRoute` method.

If the Service is not designed to be extend of reused the `@Route` annotation is the simplest way

```js

    @Route("/myroute", ["GET"])
    myHandler(ctx: Context) {
        // Do something
    }
```

If you plan to reuse your component, it might be a good idea to make its routes configurable to avoid any conflicts.

```js
class MyService extends Service {
    resolve() {
        super.resolve();
        this._addRoute(...)
    }
}
```

### Retrieve parameters

## Deployment

So you have a Application that works and is ready to deploy, the Deployment is a unit of Deployers that will lift your Application and deploy it to Kubernetes, Docker, Lambda.

A `Deployer` will create the Docker image and push it, or create the `.zip` to send to Lambda

## Application

This is your whole application including the `package.json` and the `webda.config.json`, so it is a group of `Services` and `Modules` defining your global application

## Modules

You can create a module to share some behavior between different application by defining a `webda.module.json`

Webda on startup scan the node_modules for `webda.module.json`, it build its map of available ServicesType according to theses modules.

### Shell module

You add your custom command to the `webda` shell command by adding a `webda.shell.json`
