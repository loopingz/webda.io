# Webda v4

The motivation behind v4 is to provide more documentation, a new Eventing system based on cloudevents, a new Cache system.

The number of breaking changes should mostly concerns the events.

## Core

- Application: define the services, models
- Core: create and manage the services it is available as a singleton in the application `Core.get()`

Default services:

- ConfigurationService
- CryptoService
- Registry
- EventService
- CacheService
- SessionManager
- Logger?

Default services are considered as core services and are always available in the application.

## Entrypoints

Once the application is created, you can expose it through

REST API
GraphQL
_Websocket_
_GRPC_

## EventService

We are not using the NodeJS event anymore as events through your application can flow between different micro-services, instances of the application, etc.

The EventService is based on the CloudEvents specification and is used to emit and listen to events.

To emit an event just do:

```
// To emit without waiting for the event to be processed
new MyEvent(...).emit(true);
// or if the event requires to be processed
await new MyEvent(...).emit();
```

To listen to an event, you create a CloudEvents subscription:

```

```
