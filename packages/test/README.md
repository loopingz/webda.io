# @webda/test

This module is used to test the Webda framework.

It aims to abstract the test framework used, and also allow to test the Node AsyncStorage without changing the test paradigm.

The annotations `@test` and `@suite` are inspired by the `@testdeck/core` module.

It includes features to store logs of each failing test.
