### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **compiler:** the accessors, loadParameters and unserializer modules are removed. They wrote into the sources what webdac build now generates through @webda/content-mapper, or methods nothing calls. The unused webdac build --code flag is removed too.
* @webda/ts-plugin and the `tsc-esm` binary are removed, and applications now build with TypeScript 7.1. Generated code changes where TypeScript 6 was wrong, each verified against the shipped output:
    - AuditEntry.timestamp, declared `number`, is no longer coerced to Date;
    - AbstractOwnerModel no longer emits `new ModelLink(T)`, a ReferenceError
      on first raw-uuid assignment;
    - sample-app's `User extends WebdaUser` is now treated as a model (TS6's
      base-chain guard was keyed on class name), so its relations are
      initialised and coerced;
    - imports use the specifier the author wrote, not monorepo-relative paths
      that only resolve inside this repository;
    - the emitted .d.ts is valid (TS6 referenced PrimaryKeyType unimported and
      wrote BelongTo without its type argument).
    A build that cannot write its module now fails; under TS6 a strict
    file-naming violation was logged and the build still reported success.
* **compiler:** model relations are now `type: "string"` in Input, Output and Stored schemas instead of an object with no properties, and six services gain the `type` property they inherit from ServiceParameters. Anything generated from these schemas — API validation, client types — changes with them.
