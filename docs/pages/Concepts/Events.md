# Events

The framework use the EventEmitter for events.

`emit()` this will not wait for any promise returned by listeners

`emitSync()` this will wait for resolution on all promises returned by listeners

We also have a mechanism to listen asynchronously to events. They will then be posted to a Queue for them
to be consumed through a `AsyncEvent.worker()`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
	participant S as Service
	participant As as AsyncEventService
	participant Q as Queue
    participant Aw as AsyncEventService Worker
    As->>S: Bind event to a sendQueue listener
	activate As
	S->>As: Emit event
    As->>Q: Push the event to the queue
	deactivate As
	Aw->>Q: Consume queue
	Aw->>Aw: Call the original listener
```

## Runtime Events

To implement some clients listeners we can allow listeners by uuid

addModelListener(model: string, uuid: string) // fullUuid?
removeModelListener(model: string, uuid: string) // fullUuid?

Get the current map
The Pub/Sub will then send all events for this uuid.
