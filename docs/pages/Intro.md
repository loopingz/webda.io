This is a typescript framework to create applications.

It provides the features we think every application should have: Authentication, Authorization, Logging, Monitoring, Configuration, Database Abstraction, Realtime events, GraphQL, REST API.

It is articulated around 4 main concepts:

 - Application: Define the configuration and link all components together
 - Model: Define the data structure and the business logic around it
 - Service: Implement specific features that are not directly related to one model
